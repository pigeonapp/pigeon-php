# Pigeon

Pigeon lets you easily manage your outbound email, push notifications and SMS. Visit https://pigeonapp.io for more details.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Pigeon is through Composer.

```shell
$ composer require pigeon/pigeon
```

## Usage

```php
$pigeon = new Pigeon\Client('PIGEON_PUBLIC_KEY', 'PIGEON_PRIVATE_KEY');
```

Public (`PIGEON_PUBLIC_KEY`) and private (`PIGEON_PRIVATE_KEY`) keys would be retrieved from the env variables if not passed.

### Prepare for the delivery

```php
$message_identifier = 'message-identifier';
$parcels = ['to' => 'john@example.com'];
```

- Message identifier is used to identify the message. Grab this from your Pigeon dashboard.
- Parcels array accepts `to`, `cc`, `bcc` and `data`.

### Deliver

```php
$pigeon->deliver($message_identifier, $parcels);
```

### Parcel sample (Single recipient)

```php
$parcels = [
  'to' => 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
  'cc' => [
    'admin@example.com',
    'Sales Team <sales@example.com>'
  ],
  'data' => [
    // template variables are added here
    'name' => 'John'
  ],
  'attachments' => [
    // `file` can be local file path, remote URL or a file pointer resource
    [
      'file' => '/path/to/image.png',
      'name' => 'Logo'
    ],
    [
      'file' => 'https://example.com/guide.pdf',
      'name' => 'Guide'
    ]
  ]
];
```

### Parcel sample (Multiple recipients)

```php
$parcels = [
  [
    'to' => 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
    'data' => [
      // template variables are added here
      'name' => 'John'
    ]
  ],
  [
    'to' => 'Jane Doe <jane@example.com>',
    'data' => [
