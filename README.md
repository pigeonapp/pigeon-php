## Installation

The recommended way to install Pigeon is through Composer.

```shell
$ composer require pigeon/pigeon
```

## Usage

```php
$pigeon = new Pigeon\Client('PIGEON_PUBLIC_KEY', 'PIGEON_PRIVATE_KEY');
```
Public (`PIGEON_PUBLIC_KEY`) and private (`PIGEON_PRIVATE_KEY`) keys would be retrieved from the env variables if not passed.

### Prepare for the delivery
```php
$message_identifier = 'message-identifier';
$parcels = ['to' => 'john@example.com'];
```
- Message identifier is used to identify the message. Grab this from your Pigeon dashboard.
- Parcels array accepts `to`, `cc`, `bcc` and `data`.

### Deliver
```php
$pigeon->deliver($message_identifier, $parcels);
```

### Parcel sample
```php
$parcels = [
  'to' => 'John Doe <john@example.com>',
  'cc' => [
    'admin@example.com',
    'Sales Team <sales@example.com>'
  ],
  'data' => [
    // message placeholder values are added here
    'greeting' => 'Hello John!'
  ]
];
```
